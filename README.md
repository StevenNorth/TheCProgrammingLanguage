# The C Programming Language
All exercises performed while reading through the book of the same name by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

The purpose of this repo is to practice using GitHub and learn C while reading The C Progamming Language Second Edition.

Each chapter will represent the master file version of the same number and will be commited as such. I will be using Microsoft Visual Studio to create branches, edit, commit changes and make pull requests.

Note: This README.md was written with little knowledge of how Visual Studio works with github but hopefully makes sense. I will edit it as I go.
